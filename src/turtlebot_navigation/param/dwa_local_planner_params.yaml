  max_trans_vel: 1.0 #0.7 choose slightly less than the base's capability,by lyy: The absolute value of the maximum translational velocity for the robot in m/s

  # Warning!
  #   do not set min_trans_vel to 0.0 otherwise dwa will always think translational velocities
  #   are non-negligible and small in place rotational velocities will be created.
